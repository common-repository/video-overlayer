In other words, whatever the image size was when it was clicked, this is the new size of the video. This is a great way to make your embeded videos branded, cleaner, faster loading and responsive (ie. Mobile Friendly)."

YouTube iFrame Video Embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/...\" attributes have the word \"youtube\" in them so that's what is used to include it in the supported list above). Once you've determined the correct text to add just be sure to wrap it in single quotes and comma separate it from the others making sure to leave off the last (trailing) comma. Just use the above list as a reference and you should be fine."
